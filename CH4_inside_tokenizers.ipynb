For example, there are over 500,000 words in the English language, so to build a map from each word to an input ID we‚Äôd need to keep track of that many IDs. Furthermore, words like ‚Äúdog‚Äù are represented differently from words like ‚Äúdogs‚Äù, and the model will initially have no way of knowing that ‚Äúdog‚Äù and ‚Äúdogs‚Äù are similar: it will identify the two words as unrelated. The same applies to other similar words, like ‚Äúrun‚Äù and ‚Äúrunning‚Äù, which the model will not see as being similar initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need a custom token to represent words that are not in our vocabulary. This is known as the ‚Äúunknown‚Äù token, often represented as ‚Äù[UNK]‚Äù or ‚Äù<unk>‚Äù. It‚Äôs generally a bad sign if you see that the tokenizer is producing a lot of these tokens, as it wasn‚Äôt able to retrieve a sensible representation of a word and you‚Äôre losing information along the way. The goal when crafting the vocabulary is to do it in such a way that the tokenizer tokenizes as few words as possible into the unknown token.\n",
